# html

Have you ever wanted to see the HTML on a website while also looking at the website? Is using the console to see source HTML too easy for you?

Artist's Statement:
HTML is a Chrome extension that exposes the html behind websites. By exposing what your browser processes every time a webpage is loaded, HTML gives the user access to a part of the hidden world in which your computer lives. By exposing the inner workings of websites, HTML allows the computer to look back at the user.
